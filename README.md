# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using
linear regression to estimate house prices based on relevant features.
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of developing,
evaluating, and interpreting a regression model.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the housing dataset
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data
- Performed exploratory data analysis
- Selected relevant features for prediction
- Built a linear regression model
- Evaluated the model using MSE and R-squared metrics
- Visualized actual vs predicted house prices

## Outcome & Learnings
- Successfully built a baseline regression model
- Understood how different features influence house prices
- Gained practical experience with regression modeling
- Learned how to evaluate predictive models effectively

## Project Files
- `Task5_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` – Main notebook
- `Housing.csv` – Dataset used for prediction
